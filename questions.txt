Regents Competition

	Separate into groups shown by teacher.
	Everyone should have a reference table, calculator and scrap paper ready.
	Choose a captain for your team.  The captain needs to have a smartphone or pick up a computer and be able to log into Jupiter, choose “Tests and Lessons”, and read the questions to the group.
	The competition will have a time limit so it is suggested you skip the tougher, mathematical questions.  The Juno program will come back to the ones you skipped at the end.
	If you are using a smartphone, choose the “text only” version and use the sheets that follow for the images.  If using the computer, choose the regular version; the images will be there.
